# dotfiles


## fonts
In editors, current favorite is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) which supports some awesome font ligatures.

## Bash 
[This](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070) is pretty close to how I've set up my current bash set up, except I use Droid Sans Mono patched for Powerline. I also tend to crank up the brightness of the colors (especially green, #228b22, and yellow, #ffc72c) Additionally, I needed to manually set the "bright" colors in iTerm2, or else they just show the super saturated colors.

## vim
Download [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)'s implementation of Vim's dotfiles, then add the local one from this repo (just changes the airline theme)
