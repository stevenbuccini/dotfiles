# dotfiles


## fonts
Current favorite is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) which supports some awesome font ligatures.


## vim
Download [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)'s implementation of Vim's dotfiles, then add the local one from this repo (just changes the airline theme)
